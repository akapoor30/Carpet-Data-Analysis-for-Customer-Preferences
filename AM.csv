3,Glamocracy Plastic Floor Mat.,"I have received Geovik Plastic Floor mat, when I had ordered Glamocracy. Not too sure if Glamocracy and Geovik are part of the same group. I had already once returned the earlier mat since it was not as per the specs that I had ordered. Hence did not go ahead with a second time return back of the product ordered."
