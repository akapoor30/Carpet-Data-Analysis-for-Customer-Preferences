4,Nice quality,The mat is very delicate but makes ur home look vibrant and lovely
4,Good,Length good. Width could have been more. Stuff is good
3,Its kind of chatai but cover with cotton cloth,Average product. Not the best. Buy if you want to use it occasionally
3,Thickness is very less,Stitching quality is good but thickness is not as expected
4,Beautifully crafted,I really like the product. Finishing is very good. Beautifully crafted. Edges are covered with a fabric piping. I thought it's a single piece wide whereas clubbed with multiple strips. Maybe to make it foldable. Not sure how long it's gonna last. But overall very happy with the product. I really appreciate efforts taken to make this product.
5,Good quality!,"Happy with the purchase. Good quality and design, perfect size too. Thank you!"
3,Is small than what we feel from image.,Only two is sleep on it. very thin although compact and red looks really good and can be used in front of pooja rom
5,Good product but slightly costly,"The product is very good, but the pricing could have been a little less"
4,Material is not durable but easy to carry for outdoor,"Material is not durable but easy to carry any place and good for indian home,we can fold this carpet as per our need.easy to maintain.pet and kid friendly.Starting as 4 because of very poor quality packaging.Vendor packaging quality need to improve"
2,Quality is not good,"Quality of this product is not good , It got torned after iths first day use only , and the damage got wider , also it started to get damaged from other end side also ,and not it has hurt my elbow , I have Bought these mats earlier also they are in good condition from 2 months of use also , but this time I got very poor qualitythats why I am returning this"
1,Came in open condition with tampered labels.,Poor drlivery. Csme in open condition with tampered labels
5,Liked it very much,Looks awesome. Well knitted. Quality of work is excellent. Thank you for such a lovely handicraft product.
5,Beautiful,The stitching is even more beautiful in real. Very happy. Just the threads could have been better quality. Some of them ripped in my garden after few uses.
3,It's average,The product is too sleeky and wouldn't be affordable to use as it is
4,Good product,Expected it to be slightly bigger in terms of width. Apart from that its a good quality mat
4,It’s always comes handy for a lot of times,It’s always needed either for lying down during back pain or going out doors to sit
3,I want bigger one mat,Required little big mat. So want to replace this. Please arrange to pick up returns.
5,Good,Good
3,Shorter than specified,"Workmanship is good. But it is shorter (66"" only, not 72"") than specified. Had to return because it doesn't meet my requirements."
4,A bit thin,Look wise and material wise very good. But a bit thin
5,Worth for money,I m very happy with this product.. it is more beautiful than picture shown above..Very nice product..go for it.. thank u amazon
3,Looks beautiful but is definitely not comfortable,"The mat looks good and so does the design. However, the density of the mat is so less that you don't even feel like you were sitting on one. It's almost like sitting on the floor even after sitting on the mat. If the density was better then there is nothing to comment on this product."
2,Product is not upto the mark,Product is expensive when compared to the quality and comfort. It is made with grass sticks and threads. In many places grass sticks are coming out. Thread knitting is not strong enough to hold the grass sticks and thread together. It's not Rs.1000 worth definately
4,It is nice only one problem how to wash or clean because it is an organic,Good but how to clean if we put water then it may not last long .
1,Size mismatch and low quality,I ordered 2 mats in a single order of same size and one was smaller than quoted size. Also the quality of the product is very low.
4,Worth buying this,Worth buying this . Very soft and good quality product . Can be used as carpet

4,Elegant,I have brought 2 of these. It's like ur yoga mat but made of grass. Looks elegant for floor seating. And I am enjoying using it.

4,Please add a string so that it can be used as a curtain as well.,Good product
4,Nice product,It's good product in comparison with other kusha asan. It's having safety with cloth boundary and finely prepared. Good finishing. Also too long that two people and a kid can sit in a row if someone wants to use while puja else it's multipurpose good feel.
5,Recommended,"Natural product. Paid a little more than INR 400. This is our second mat of this type. It is being used in the kitchen, so sees a significant amount of traffic. The first mat lasted for 1.5 years, which was longer than I expected. It is now being composted.In short, the mat is fit for purpose, and once worn out, it will leave not negative footprint on earth. Even the thread seems to be biodegradable."
3,Too small in size. Extremely narrow mat.,"Over priced product. Shouldn’t be more than 200 rupees for it.The mat is very narrow , it is also the size of a yoga mat. If you put it on the floor for sitting only the person can sit on it , if they lay down half his or her body will be on the floor.Definitely not worth the price. It is too small in size."

5,100% biodegradable mat,This mat is very sturdy and its simplicity is very beautiful and most other mats are made of plastic rope but this mat is woven from jute rope which I like very much. And it's 100% biodegradable which is extra special. I've been looking for something like this for so long. Thank you for selling it on amazon. The only package is non-biodegradable . I understand that you used bubble wrap to make it safe. They say it will take 500 years to decompose from this earth. Try to use any alternative products. thank you very much.

5,Durable and ,Best korai grass mats for outdoor use
5,"Highly recommended, traditional,best quality","First of all, it's having nice have to it. The size is as mentioned.
The organic grass layers are kept side by side and bolstered together by coloured threads to give a pattern Since the grass comes in particular size only (which is long enough), the full width is made by folding equal sized layers which is innovative.
The texture is the one which reminds me of the childhood so I bought it. It's definite recommended, a useful addition to any home. Pictures of beautiful texture are attached."
